        Many thanks to him.
        + Add : The --dist-opts 'header' and 'footer', that respectively prepend
                and append any text to the ebuilds.
        + Add : The samples/g-cpanp shell script (don't forget to set the proper
                keywords).
        + Add : Add 'SRC_TEST="do"' in the ebuids so that tests are run when
                'test' is set in FEATURES.
        + Fix : Only the modules in the modules list were fetchable.
