Revision history for CPANPLUS-Dist-Gentoo

0.06    2009-02-14 18:15 UTC
        + Chg : The new CPANPLUS::Dist::Gentoo::Maps holds the gentooisms and
                provides routines for converting CPAN versions to Gentoo.
                version.pm is longer required.
        + Chg : Generate ebuild for the current dist before recursing.
        + Fix : Prevent infinite loop when forcing a distribution with recursive
                dependencies.
        + Fix : Remove duplicated dependencies from DEPEND.
        + Upd : Resources in META.yml.
        + Tst : Test gentooisms and version mappings.

0.05    2009-01-25 00:30 UTC
        + Add : Many more gentooisms, and a script to generate them.
        + Add : Get the default values of options from emerge --info's output: 
                - the overlay from PORTDIR_OVERLAY ;
                - the keywords from ACCEPT_KEYWORDS ;
                - the distdir from DISTDIR ;
                - the main portage tree from PORTDIR.
        + Chg : Search in the portage tree for the category (including virtuals)
                each dependency belongs, and state it explictely in the ebuild's
                DEPEND. This change was made necessary because portage recently
                stopped accepting non-existent atoms in || ( ) constructs.
        + Fix : Append our overlay to the ones specified in PORTDIR_OVERLAY (if
                it's not listed yet) when running commands.

        This release was motivated by Kent Fredric's suggestions in RT #41483.
        Many thanks to him.
        + Add : The --dist-opts 'header' and 'footer', that respectively prepend
                and append any text to the ebuilds.
        + Add : The samples/g-cpanp shell script (don't forget to set the proper
                keywords).
        + Add : Add 'SRC_TEST="do"' in the ebuids so that tests are run when
                'test' is set in FEATURES.
        + Fix : Only the modules in the modules list were fetchable.

0.03    2008-11-29 18:45 UTC
        + Add : --force regenerates ebuilds.
        + Fix : Flaky perl -> portage version conversion.
        + Fix : Prerequisites weren't relinked through gentooisms.
        + Fix : Generating Manifests with user-defined distdir and overlay.
        + Upd : META.yml spec updated to 1.4.

0.02_01 2008-05-26 22:35 UTC
        + Add : The 'keywords' option.
        + Chg : From now, the portage category is perl-gcpanp, for consistency
                with g-cpan.
        + Fix : Empty emerge command.
        + Fix : Missing '-C' to the uninstall command.
        + Fix : Removed an useless debug message.
