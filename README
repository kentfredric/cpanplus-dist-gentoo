DESCRPITON
    This module is a CPANPLUS backend that recursively generates Gentoo
    ebuilds for a given package in the specified overlay (defaults to
    /usr/local/portage), updates the manifest, and even emerges it (together
    with its dependencies) if the user requires it. You need write
    permissions on the directory where Gentoo fetches its source files
    (usually /usr/portage/distfiles). The valid "KEYWORDS" for the generated
    ebuilds are by default those given in "ACCEPT_KEYWORDS", but you can
    specify your own with the "keywords" dist-option.

    The generated ebuilds are placed into the "perl-gcpanp" category. They
    favour depending on a "virtual", on "perl-core", "dev-perl" or
    "perl-gcpan" (in that order) rather than "perl-gcpanp".

INSTALLATION
    After installing this module, you should append "perl-gcpanp" to your
    /etc/portage/categories file.

METHODS
    All the methods are inherited from CPANPLUS::Dist::Base. Please refer to
    its documentation for precise information on what's done at each step.
